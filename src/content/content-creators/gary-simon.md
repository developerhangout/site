Gary Simon here of the DesignCourse YouTube Channel! I started off with FrontPage 97 when I was in middle school (I'm 35 now, an old man in internet years). I loved the world of design and dev so much that I knew it's what I wanted to do. I skipped the college route and went straight into freelance work for quite awhile.

My very first tutorial was way back in 2006 (in written form). I started creating courses around 2012 for the Envato Network. Then, I published courses for DigitalTutors, Pluralsight, and a few for LinkedIn Learning (formerly Lynda.com). My channel (DesignCourse) has always been around for quite awhile, where I'm quite active these days.

Outside of my career, I have a wife with 2 daughters that we homeschool. I'm a guitar nut, trying to become the next Yngwie Malmsteen ;). I also like the gym and running -- I ran my first marathon in 2018.

...and that's me.
