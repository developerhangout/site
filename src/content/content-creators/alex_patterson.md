# Alex Patterson
Hello, my name is Alex. 

I am the founder of AJonP Purr-fect Solutions. I have a Bachelor’s degree in Information Systems and a Master’s degree in Computer Information Systems from Grand Valley State University. My education focused on Java, PHP, HTML, and CSS, but my career began as an ABAP developer in SAP® in Holland, Michigan. Like many people, my passion for the web drove me to search for the right career path. Luckily I was able to make a career transition and become a front-end developer, but even as I say that I still write SAP® Gateway services, NodeJs middleware, and C# server back-ends for API’s.

After fifteen years of enterprise experience, I realize that I want to give back to the development community that has allowed me to become who I am today. I fully believe that anyone can learn to be a developer, and I am here to help!
